<h1>AI Projects</h1>
This GitHub repository contains a collection of Artificial Intelligence projects implemented in Python.

<h1>2D_SearchAlgorithms.py</h1>
This module contains the implementation of various search algorithms such as BFS, Greedy Best First Search, and A star algorithm on a 2D space. These algorithms can be used to find the shortest path between two points in a grid or to search for a goal state in a search problem.

<h1>crossoverAlg.py</h1>
This module contains the implementation of a crossover genetic algorithm to solve function optimization problems. The algorithm uses a combination of two parent chromosomes to create a new offspring chromosome, which is then mutated to explore the search space. This algorithm can be used to find the optimal solution for various optimization problems.

<h1>geneticAlg.py</h1>
This module contains the implementation of a genetic algorithm with a roulette selection to solve function optimization problems. The algorithm uses a population of chromosomes that undergo selection and mutation to produce a new generation of chromosomes. This algorithm can be used to find the optimal solution for various optimization problems.

<h1>nQueen_RRHC.py</h1>
This module contains the implementation of a random restart hill climb algorithm to solve the nQueen problem. The nQueen problem involves placing n chess queens on an n x n chessboard so that no two queens attack each other. The algorithm uses a random restart strategy to avoid getting stuck in a local optimum.

<h1>nQueen_min-conflict.py</h1>
This module contains the implementation of a minimum conflict algorithm to solve the nQueen problem. The algorithm uses a heuristic function that counts the number of conflicts between queens on the board and moves a queen to a position with minimum conflicts. This algorithm can be used to find a solution to the nQueen problem quickly.

<h1>Conclusion</h1>
These AI projects are useful for learning and experimenting with various Artificial Intelligence algorithms.
